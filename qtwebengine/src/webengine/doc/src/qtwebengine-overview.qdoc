    \title Qt WebEngine Overview

    The Qt WebEngine module provides a web browser engine that makes it easy to embed content from
    the World Wide Web into your Qt application on platforms that do not have a native web engine.
    The web engine is not intended to function as a \e {Web Runtime}; to display web content in a
    QML application by using APIs native to the platform, use the \l{Qt WebView} module, instead.

    Qt WebEngine provides C++ classes and QML types for rendering HTML, XHTML, and SVG documents,
    styled using Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripted with JavaScript. HTML documents can be
    made fully editable by the user through the use of the \c{contenteditable} attribute on HTML
    elements.

    Qt WebEngine supercedes the \l{http://doc.qt.io/archives/qt-5.3/qtwebkit-index.html}{Qt WebKit}
    module, which is based on the
    WebKit project, but has not been actively synchronized with the upstream WebKit code since
    Qt 5.2 and has been deprecated in Qt 5.5. For tips on how to change a Qt WebKit widgets
    application to use Qt WebEngine widgets, see \l{Porting from Qt WebKit to Qt WebEngine}. For new
    applications, we recommend using Qt Quick and the WebEngineView QML type.

    \section1 Qt WebEngine Architecture

    \image qtwebengine-architecture.png

    The functionality in Qt WebEngine is divided into the following modules:

    \list
        \li \l{Qt WebEngine Widgets}, which provides a web browser engine and C++ classes to render
            web content and to interact with it
        \li \l{Qt WebEngine}, which provides QML types for rendering web content within a QML
            application
        \li \l{Qt WebEngine Core}, which provides common API used by Qt WebEngine and
            Qt WebEngine Widgets
    \endlist

    The Qt WebEngine core is based on the \l {Chromium Project}. Chromium provides its own network
    and painting engines and is developed tightly together with its dependent modules, and
    therefore Qt WebEngine provides better and more reliable support for the latest HTML5
    specification than Qt WebKit. However, Qt WebEngine is thus heavier than Qt WebKit and does
    not provide direct access to the network stack and the HTML document through C++ APIs.

    Please note that Qt WebEngine is based on Chromium, but does not contain or use any services
    or add-ons that might be part of the Chrome browser that is built and delivered by Google.
    You can find more detailed information about the differences between Chromium and Chrome in this
    \l{https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/docs/chromium_browser_vs_google_chrome.md}{overview}
    that is part of the documentation in the \l {Chromium Project} upstream source tree.

    Chromium is tightly integrated to the \l{Qt Quick Scene Graph}{Qt Quick scene graph}, which is
    based on OpenGL ES 2.0 or OpenGL 2.0 for its rendering. This provides you with one-pass
    compositing of web content and all the Qt Quick UI. The integration to Chromium is transparent
    to developers, who just work with Qt and JavaScript.

    To expose QObjects to JavaScript, developers can use the \l {Qt WebChannel} module.

    \section1 Embedding Web Content into Widget Based Applications

    Use the QWebEngineView class to display web pages in the simplest way. Because it is a widget,
    you can embed QWebEngineView into your forms and use its convenience functions to download and
    display web sites.

    \code
    QWebEngineView *view = new QWebEngineView(parent);
    view->load(QUrl("http://www.qt.io/"));
    view->show();
    \endcode

    An instance of QWebEngineView has one QWebEnginePage. QWebEnginePage provides access to the
    page's navigation history and the ability to run JavaScript code in the context of the page's
    main frame and enables customization of handlers for specific events like showing custom
    authentication dialogs.

    \section1 Embedding Web Content into Qt Quick Applications

    The WebEngineView QML type allows QML applications to render regions of dynamic web content. A
    \e{WebEngineView} type may share the screen with other QML types or encompass the full screen
    as specified within the QML application.

    An application can load pages into the WebEngineView, using either an URL or HTML string, and
    navigate within session history. By default, links to different pages load within the same
    WebEngineView object, but web sites may request them to be opened as a new tab, window, or
    dialog.

    The following sample QML application loads a web page and responds to session history context:

    \qml
    import QtQuick 2.1
    import QtQuick.Controls 1.1
    import QtWebEngine 1.1

    ApplicationWindow {
        width: 1280
        height: 720
        visible: true
        WebEngineView {
            id: webview
            url: "http://www.qt.io"
            anchors.fill: parent
        }
    }
    \endqml

    \section1 Using WebEngine Core

    Qt WebEngine Core provides an API shared by Qt WebEngine and Qt WebEngine Widgets for handling
    URL requests issued for the networking stack of Chromium and for accessing its HTTP cookies.

    Implementing the QWebEngineUrlRequestInterceptor interface and installing the interceptor on a
    profile enables intercepting, blocking, and modifying URL requests (QWebEngineUrlRequestInfo)
    before they reach the networking stack of Chromium.

    A QWebEngineUrlSchemeHandler can be registered for a profile to add support for custom URL
    schemes. Requests for the scheme are then issued to QWebEngineUrlSchemeHandler::requestStarted()
    as QWebEngineUrlRequestJob objects.

    The QWebEngineCookieStore class provides functions for accessing HTTP cookies of Chromium.
    The functions can be used to synchronize cookies with QNetworkAccessManager, as well as to set,
    delete, and intercept cookies during navigation.
